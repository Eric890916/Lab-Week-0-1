### Introduction
Hello, my name is [Eric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hungyuko/). I am currently a fourth-year student pursuing a **Cognitive Science** *with a Specialization in Design and Interaction* major with a minor in **computer science** at the **University of California, San Diego**. In my free time, I watch YouTube and Netflix and play video games. As you can tell from the picture above, I am a cat person. The cat in the picture is my roommate's cat during my internship at Irvine. His name is Uni, and I really enjoyed his accompany during my time at Irvine. Hopefully, I can get my own cat in the future. 

### Who I am as a Programmer
I have learned and used 
1. Python, 
2. Java, 
3. C, 
4. C++, 
5. HTML, 
6. CSS, 
7. JavaScript, 
8. MySQL, 
9. PHP,
10. Apache, 
11. Linux

I am trying to learn other programming languages or strengthen my previously known skills step by step. I do not consider myself an experienced programmer since I declared my future career path as a software engineer in my third year, which is later than the other. Luckily, I had the chance to intern at [Advantech](https://www.advantech.com) as an Application Engineer this summer at Irvine. During the internship, I developed a webpage to monitor server machines that provide instant updates on 
- FRU, 
- PoE, 
- DMIDECODE, 
- sensors and 
- controls PoE ports. 
  
I also Assembled server machines and conducted 
- memory tests, 
- CPU tests, 
- and other testings 

to ensure the quality of deliverables. 

On my first day of internship, the general manager said this to the interns at the orientation: 

> better to try and fail than not try at all.

I made many mistakes during the internship, which is why I learned a lot during my internship.
